# nftree-eco-backend

The backend for nftree.eco

## What is nftree.eco?

nftree.eco is a tree adoption website with one goal: plant more trees. I will
work with cities who have documented planted trees in their neighborhoods and
turn them into non-fungible tokens for users to purchase. After you purchase a
token you could also trade it with a friend via a token address.

## TODO

- [ ] Verify email on register (hailgun?)

## Adding a haskell package from GitHub

- `niv add {githubUsername}/{packageName}`
- In `default.nix`, add the following in `myHaskellPackages`
```
"{packageName}" =
  hself.callCabal2nix
    "{packageName}"
    (sources.{packageName})
    {};
```
